            <! -- Make sure to put a picture in between the quotes here, but make sure that when you load it in at the same level. 
            Add it to the wdd130 folder and it will appear in here! In the alt tab you need to have a description of what the picture is
            supposed to be. You will be sued if you are working on a government page and you do not include this.-- >

        <p>I absolutely love theatre and I love to write poetry, especially when I'm in my "feels." 
            I love sports and board games and any kind of game. I'm kind of a jack of all trades and I'm super easy going.</p>
