            <h2>My connection to pottery.</h2>
 
            <h2>All my life I have been fascinated with making pottery on a wheel. It just looked like fun, but I never had an opportunity to do it, until I visited my first duty on active duty in the Armyâ€”Ft Polk Louisiana, now called Ft Johnson. The military installations are geared towards keeping the troops happy, and that means keeping them occupied in their off-duty hours. One of the big facets of such activity is the system of recreation facilities on military installations. Ft Polk had a collection of pottery wheels and kilns, and some people to help the troops learn. I jumped right in and quickly became fascinated with the process.</h2>
         
            <h2>I didn not have many opportunities at other installations because each seems to have a different focus, whether auto mechanics, wood working, lapidary, photography, or whatever. However, after we moved to Twin Falls I signed up for pottery classes at CSI. Then I was hooked. I took the class 3 times, each with a different instructor, so I learned different approaches and became motivated to get involved. I found some older used equipment, a wheel and a kiln, in the community, which I bought and cleared out a space for in my small shop.</h2>
         
            <h2>Over the years I have upgraded my equipment. I now have two wheels and a nice electric kiln. I had a gas kiln but decided the electric was easier to use. Now I am retired from dental practice, so I spend about 15-20 hours per week in my studio. It is relaxing and I enjoy creating esthetic and useful pieces. I enjoy the breadth of what pottery includes. I once wondered how someone could get a Masters of Fine Arts in pottery and ceramics. Now I know that pottery and ceramics is a field that is absolutely open for anybody who wants to do it, and for whatever reason they choose.</h2>
